Her passion for Zumba led her to become an instructor in 2011. One summer she was on vacation and saw that her favorite instructor was vacation in the same city and was teaching a special drop in class! Tommi thought \"I wish I could take my Zumba instructor everywhere with me!\" That was the genesis of Azucar Fitness. Tommi teaches Zumba Basic 1 classes for the true beginner. Moves are fun but not complicated. As she says, \"Simple does not mean EASY.\" She loves the club music and latin pop, so you will recognize some of the songs. Enjoy!</p>\n        </div>\n        \n        <div class=\"clearfix\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000;\">\n            <div class=\"inline left\" style=\"padding: 1.5em;\"><img src=\"images/small-dave-profile-pic.jpg\" alt=\"Dave\" /></div>\n            <p class=\"inline left\" style=\"max-width: 65%;\">David has been coaching people in fitness since 2009.
